# 🧠 CatBoost Classifier: Introvert vs Extrovert Prediction
This project demonstrates the use of the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify personality types — distinguishing between Introverts and Extroverts — based on behavioral and psychological data.

📁 File
catboost-model-introvert-vs-extrovert.ipynb: A complete Jupyter Notebook including:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding

Model training and evaluation

Feature importance visualization

🚀 Project Objectives
Build a robust classification model to identify personality types.

Explore the performance of the CatBoost algorithm on structured data.

Visualize important features that influence personality classification.

📊 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

CatBoost (gradient boosting on decision trees)

Scikit-learn (for metrics)

🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

📌 Key Findings
Feature importance highlights key behavioral traits linked to introversion and extroversion.

CatBoost handles categorical features natively, which boosts model efficiency and accuracy.
